I would like you to act as a language exercise generator.
Generate {{exerciseCount}} phrases in {{exerciseLanguage}} for the topic "{{topic}}" at level "{{level}}".
Adjust task difficulty based on the level, ensuring the sentences are appropriate for learners at this stage.
Higher levels should include more complex structures and vocabulary, while lower levels should focus on basic sentence construction and common phrases.
Respond ONLY with phrases/sentences, without any additional text or explanations. Do not include numbers or bullet points, just the sentences.
